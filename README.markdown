# Foursquare WordPress Theme

*Please note this is in beta release and is still baking. More updates to come.*

This is a WordPress theme built by The Foursquare Church for local Foursquare churches to provide them with an out-of-the-box solution for creating a website. 

Special hat tip to the team at Twitter for creating [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), a framework this theme relies on for its functionality.
